        I am Jiqun Liu from the library and information studies department and I
        invite you to participate in my research entitled Functional Fixedness
        Evaluation in Human-LLM Interaction. This research is being conducted at
        the usability lab at the school of library and information studies, but
        you as our online participant will be participating remotely via your
        own computer. You were selected as a possible participant because you
        meet the eligibility requirement for the study. You must be at least 18

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>What is the purpose of this research? </strong>
        This research aims to study the functional fixedness in human-Large
        Language Model (LLM) interaction, specifically focusing on users'
        intention distribution and interaction behaviors in both search engine
        and ChatGPT settings.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>How many participants will be in this research? </strong>
        About 800-1,000 online participants will take part in this research.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>What will I be asked to do? </strong>
        If you agree to be in this research, you will be asked to perform a task
        using ChatGPT and answer a questionnaire about your search engine usage.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>How long will this take? </strong>
        Your participation will take 35-40 minutes.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>What are the risks and benefits if I participate? </strong>
        We will keep the logs of your task performance. We will not ask for
        names or any personal information. These logs are not identifiable to
        each participant.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Will I be compensated for participating? </strong>
        Each participant will receive a $8 upon completion.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Who will see my information? </strong>
        There will be no information in research reports that will make it
        possible to identify you. Research records will be stored securely, and
        only approved researchers and the OU Institutional Review Board will
        have access to the records.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Do I have to participate? </strong>
        No. If you do not participate, you will not be penalized or lose
        benefits or services unrelated to the research. If you decide to
        participate, you don't have to answer any questions and can stop
        participating at any time.
